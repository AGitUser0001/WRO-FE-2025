## The Open Challenge
The robot must complete three laps on the track after being placed randomly inside the walls of the track. The robot must have one button pressed to turn on the robot and one button pressed to run the program. After this, **no further interactions** with the robot are allowed.
## The Obstacle Challenge
The robot must complete three laps on the track with randomly arranged traffic signs which are green and red. The robot must go around the **right** side of a **red** pillar, and the **left** side of a **green** pillar.

### Short Circuit
After we soldered the battery connector to the ESC and the extension board, we were ready to flip the switch. Unfortunately, we switched the positive and negative wires, resulting our extension board to be burned. This taught us to be more cautious before closing the circuit and helped us avoid similar situations along the way.
