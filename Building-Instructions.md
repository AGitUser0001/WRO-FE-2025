# Building Instructions
The construction of our robot is split up into 11 steps. Step zero being to first print our 3d prints which can be found in our 3d prints folder. Step one being to modify the chassis and soldering. Step two being to next gather all the required parts and components. Step 3 is to attach the 3d prints. Step four is to start the build by attaching the movement parts. Step five is to wire everything together. Step six is to add the sensors. Step seven is attaching the battery. Step eight is soldering the switch. Step nine to finish the build with final touches. Finally, step ten to import the code and run it.

***Step Zero:***
This step is purely dedicated to acquiring the 3d prints. You will need to find the prints in the 3d prints folder on our repository, next download them and print them out, if you are unsure on how to you can always use external help such as Google or Youtube.

***First step:***
This step is to alter your chassis to become fit for our build with a series of modifications. These being first to take out the long beam on the top which is connected to the front and rear gear boxes as it is in the way, and then secondly to take out the servo housing.

As well, this step includes soldering a wire and switch. You will need to solder a switch to a wire as well as making it have one input and two outputs, the input will be from the battery and the outputs will be into the expansion board and into the ESC for the BLDC motor.

***Second step:***
You need to gather all the parts and components for our robot, those which are listed before when we calculated the total cost of our robot. These components are a BLDC motor, a servo motor, a camera, Rasberry Pi 5, all of our 3d prints, the expansion board, our chassis, battery, wires,  switch, Velcro, tape, and electrical tape.

***Third step:***
Attaching the 3d prints. The baseplate is to be screwed in on top of the chassis with screws and extra long screw extensions, and the back part which should slide into the very back of the chassis along with the stopper that you put in through the top of the of the bottom of the backplate, there is a hole made for it.

***Fourth step:***
This step will be to attach all the parts that are involved with moving these being the BLDC motor, the servo motor, Raspberry pi 5, and the expansion board.

**Part 1.**
Attaching the servo and BLDC motors. Attach the servo motor with Velcro, and the BLDC motor with the pregiven mount that came along with the chassis.

**Part 2.**
Attaching the Raspberry Pi 5 and the expansion board. Both of these circuits will be screwed into place with screw extenders on each of the four corners in a relatively systematic fashion as each corner for their relative circuit will be the same. The images following will have the circuit encircled and each smaller screw circled also.

**Expansion Board**

***Fifth Step:***
This step will be to wire everything together; the servo motor goes to the pwm control on the expansion board and the BLDC motor will be connected to an esc which will be Velcroed to the side of the baseplate. This esc will then connect to the switch, the expansion board, and the battery. Next you will need two USB cables, one for data, one for power. The data cable will be USB C to USB A, and the power cable will be USB C to USB C. Next just attach those cables. Finally, as well add a strip of Velcro on the underside of the baseplate. This will be used to attach the battery.

***Sixth Step:***
Step six, we will be adding the lidar and the camera, the camera will be attached to the camera port on the raspberry pi 5 board, for the lidar you will add a piece of double sided tape to the bottom as we will flip it upside down and attach it a little under the camera on the back piece.

***Seventh Step:***
Step seven, attach the battery, beforehand add a strip of velcro to the back of each battery which will conjoin with the underside of the baseplate. After you attach the battery, check all of the connections first before you plug it in. Safety first!!!

***Eight Step:***
Step eight, this step you will have to solder a switch onto the main power cables.

***Nineth Step:***
For step nine you will need to tape the camera cable as well as the camera in place, attach the servo to the servo arm on the chassis, and fix the cables in place with tape or if you have them, zip ties.

***Tenth Step:***
Finally step ten is to just import our code and run it!
